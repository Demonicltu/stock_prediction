# stock_prediction

Course work practical part for Deep neural networks to predict stock price time series.

There are 3 types of neural network:
 - RNN - Recurrent Neural Network
 - 
 - CNN - Convolutional Neural Network
 - 
 - TNN - Transformer Neural Network

As well there is benchmark model (tomorrows price (predicted) is same as todays price (real))

There are 3 different stocks:
 - APRANGA = https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APG1L.VS?p=APG1L.VS

 - EUR-USD = https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EURUSD%3DX?p=EURUSD%3DX

 - ETH-USD = https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD?p=ETH-USD


Data was used from these time periods:
 - 5Y - 5 year
 - MAX - from stock release date

Data was used from these time frequencies:
 - DAILY - each day when stock is can be sold/bought
 - WEEKLY - each week data (Monday)
